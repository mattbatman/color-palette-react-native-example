# Color Palette React Native Example

This is a React Native project created while following along with [React Native, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/) on Frontend Masters by [Kadi Kraman](https://github.com/kadikraman).

A companion site replicating the course can be found [here](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/).

I used [Expo](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/setup-expo) to build this project.
